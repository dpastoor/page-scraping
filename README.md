page-scraping
=============

web scraping to pull down pdf versions of all posters that have attached pdf's from the [page website](http://www.page-meeting.org)

The code is **extremely** hacky as first time trying python. Used an ipython notebook to somewhat document the process.

Will likely use this as an example project to continue working on best practices, etc.

Eventually would like to:

* re-write code using OOP
* create a flask interface
* rewrite as a 'search engine' for multiple website (page/acop/etc) so could search a topic and pull down relevant posters
